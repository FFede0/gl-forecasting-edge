## Synopsis

This repository contains a discrete-event simulator capable of simulating Gossip Learning (GL) with various network topologies and stopping criteria.
Moreover, it contains all the experimental material for reproducing the empirical evaluation of the paper.

## Structure
```

### src
It contains the code of the Python simulator package, utility scripts to run a simulation, and numbered Jupyter Notebooks step-by-step perform an end-to-end simulation (e.g., from dataset preparation to evaluation).

### experiments
It contains all the data used for experiments, utility scripts for the analysis of the simulation results, and for plot generation.
